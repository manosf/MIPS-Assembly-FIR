# MIPS-Assembly-FIR
A simple FIR filter implemented in MIPS32 assembly.  

Development of the program(s) initially started due to a university assignment.  
Testing was done using the MARS Assembler/Simulator.  

Configuration and settings used per program:  

**--'Fewest_lines.s' program:**   
  The objective was the implemantation with the *least amount of lines/code*.  
  -Forwarding Enabled  
	-Delay Slot Disable  
	-Branch Target Buffer Disabled  
	-Multiplier Latency 2  

**--'Lowest_time.s' program:**   
  The objective was *time efficiency*. The first program was modified to eliminate stalls  
  caused by Data Dependencies and Hazards. The 'Loop Unrolling' method was applied twice in  
  the inner loop and commands flow has been rearranged. Also the setting *Delay Slot* has been  
  enabled in MARS with the respective changes in the program.  
  
The 'FIR_filter.c' file contains the original C function implementing the FIR filter.
